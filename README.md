# Kiosk Frontend

This repository holds the open source code for a Kiosk frontend application.

## How do I get set up?

TBD, but most probably a docker container. To use this, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed.

To run the app, simply run `yarn start`, then navigate to `localhost:3000`
